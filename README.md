##Presentation
Objective REST is build to provide a REST interface to any CoreData application. We have two working mode :

* Standard model: you use your CoreData model as it is, no need if change, and you got a REST interface we basic functionality (see the appropriate section for more details).

* REST Ready model: you have to patch your CoreData model to add a custom UUID field and some method to get descriptions, comparator, etc. (see the appropriate section for more details).

To use Objective REST in your application, you have to setup the RESTManager shared instance. You need to pass all CoreData parts (model, store, context) and the server settings (TCP port, SSL certificate, users databaseâ€¦) and that's all. 

You have two demo application, one server and one client to see how it's work.
